# Optional: if you prefer unsigned client uploads but still want the backend to suggest the endpoint,
# create an unsigned upload preset in your Cloudinary dashboard and set it here.

# Notes:
# - For quick testing without backend credentials, you can configure the frontend to perform unsigned
#   uploads directly to Cloudinary by setting the frontend env variables (in your frontend `.env`):
#     VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_URL=https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/<your_cloud_name>/upload
#     VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=<your_unsigned_preset>
# - Signed uploads require the three server vars above. Restart the backend after setting envs.
